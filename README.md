# knuther_java
A Java-based implementation of some of Donald Knuth's randomness tests.

Similar to my other repository "Knuther", this repository will (eventually) implement several of the randomness tests for scaled numbers described by Donald Knuth in "The Art of Computer Programming: Volume II".

In time, I will add more tests and fully flush this out.
